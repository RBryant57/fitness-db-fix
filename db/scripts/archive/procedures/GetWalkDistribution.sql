-- dbo.GetWalkDistribution
-- Changes:
--   * BUG: grouped by MONTH(Date) only (multi-year ranges merged). Now grouped by year and month.
--   * The count column was mislabelled 'Runs'; now Walks.
--   * Column names without spaces; unknown @Type raises an error; `date` parameters, end date inclusive.
